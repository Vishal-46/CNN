# Happy vs. Sad Image Classifier

## Overview
This repository is my practice ground for understanding convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It documents my very first CNN project, where I built a model that classifies images of people as either happy or sad. I followed several YouTube tutorials to guide me through the process, making this my first real dive into more advanced deep learning.

## Project Structure
- `Getting Started.ipynb`: Notebook with the end-to-end walkthrough for loading data, training, and evaluating the CNN.
- `data/`: Image dataset organized into `happy/` and `sad/` folders. The images were collected from various public internet sources for learning purposes.
- `models/imageclassifier.h5`: Saved Keras model weights from my training runs.

## Model Highlights
- Implemented with TensorFlow/Keras.
- Designed to classify images into two classes: happy or sad.
- Trained using guidance from online tutorials while experimenting with different CNN layers, activation functions, and augmentation techniques.

## Data Notes
- The dataset consists of facial images representing happy and sad expressions.
- Images were collected from various freely available internet sources solely for educational experimentation.
